# The Private Key of this account on this network
# the format is more dynamic here:
# 1. if it starts with '0x' then this would be raw (64 bytes) hex encoded
#    private key.
#    Example: 0x8917174396171783496173419137618235192359106130478137647163400318
#
# 2. if it starts with '$' then it would be considered as an Enviroment variable
#    of a hex-encoded private key.
#    Example: $OPTIMISMTESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY
#
# 3. if it starts with '> ' then it would be considered as a command that
#    the relayer would execute and the output of this command would be the
#    hex encoded private key.
#    Example: > ./getKey.sh optimismtestnet-privatekey
#
# 4. if it doesn't contains special characters and has 12 or 24 words in it
#    then we should process it as a mnemonic string: 'word two three four ...'
