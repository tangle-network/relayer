# # 2. if it starts with '$' then it would be considered as an Enviroment variable
# #    of a hex-encoded private key.
# #    Example: $RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY
# #
# # 3. if it starts with '> ' then it would be considered as a command that
# #    the relayer would execute and the output of this command would be the
# #    hex encoded private key.
# #    Example: > ./getKey.sh rinkeby-privatekey
