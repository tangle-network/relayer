## Running and Configuring 🚀

Webb Relayer is easy to run and with flexible config 👌, to test it out first you have to create a config file

Example:

* Create a `config.toml` file and add the following configuration

> By default `webb-relayer` looks for the config at ~/.config/webb-relayer/config.toml

```toml
# Webb Relayer configuration

# WebSocket Server Port number
#
# default to 9955
port = 9955

# Interprets the suri string in order to generate a key Pair.
#
# - If `suri` is a possibly `0x` prefixed 64-digit hex string, then it will
#   be interpreted
# directly as a `MiniSecretKey` (aka "seed" in `subkey`).
# - If `suri` is a valid BIP-39 key phrase of 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 words,
#   then the key will
# be derived from it. In this case:
#   - the phrase may be followed by one or more items delimited by `/`
#     characters.
#   - the path may be followed by `///`, in which case everything after
#     the `#` is treated
# as a password.
# - If `suri` begins with a `/` character it is prefixed with the Substrate
#   public `DEV_PHRASE` and
# interpreted as above.
#
# In this case they are interpreted as HDKD junctions; purely numeric
# items are interpreted as integers, non-numeric items as strings.
# Junctions prefixed with `/` are interpreted as soft junctions, and
# with `//` as hard junctions.
#
# There is no correspondence mapping between SURI strings and the keys
# they represent. Two different non-identical strings can actually
# lead to the same secret being derived. Notably, integer junction
# indices may be legally prefixed with arbitrary number of zeros.
# Similarly an empty password (ending the SURI with `///`) is perfectly
# valid and will generally be equivalent to no password at all.

suri = "//Alice" # For testing purposes.
```

Then Simply run

```
$ webb-relayer -vvv -c config.toml
```

> Hot Tip 🌶️: you could also use the json format for the config file if you prefer that, and it would work!

* Using Environment Variables:

You could override the values in the configuration file using environment variables so that config value could be prefixed with `WEBB_`

For example, use `WEBB_PORT` to override the port number, and `WEBB_SURI` to override the relayer account controller.

Thats very useful, you could create an empty config file, with empty values so that you can use env for security reasons!
