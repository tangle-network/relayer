## Install ⛹️

#### Unix (Linux, macOS, WSL2, ..)

```
curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-webb-relayer.sh | sh
```

## Running and Configuring 🚀

Webb Relayer is easy to run and with flexible config 👌, to test it out first you have to create a config file

Example:

* Create a .env file with the following values for the networks you wish to support

```
WEBB_EVM_<network>_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_<network>_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>

WEBB_EVM_<network>_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>

```

> Checkout [config](./config) for useful default configurations for many networks. These config files can be changed to your preferences, and are enabled with the .env configuration listed above.

Then Simply run

```
webb-relayer -vvv -c ./config
```

> Hot Tip 🌶️: you could also use the json format for the config files if you prefer that, and it would work!

## Running integration tests
To run substrate tests , our current docker image, or maybe the relayer has issue with events from a node running inside docker
you will need pulling the `protocol-substrate` node [repo](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-substrate).
then
create a `.evn` file on `/tests/`
```
LOCAL_NODE=true
```
```bash
# Move to tests folder tests
 cd ./tests
# Run the tests
yarn test
```
this will make the tests use the local node instead of the docker setup

## Using Docker 🐳

To Use Docker in and to run the relayer on any cloud provider, all you need is to create your configuration and .env files
as it is shown above, save it into a `config` directory then you run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CONFIGS_DIRECTORY>:/config" --env-file .env -p 9955:9955 ghcr.io/webb-tools/relayer:edge
```

> Note: this uses the latest and pre-released version deployed from `main` branch, change `edge` to the latest stable release version.

This will mount a configuration files at the `/config` directory inside the container so it would allow it to read the configuration you added.
