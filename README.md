## Install ⛹️

#### Unix (Linux, macOS, WSL2, ..)

```
curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-webb-relayer.sh | sh
```

## Running and Configuring 🚀

Webb Relayer is easy to run and with flexible config 👌, to test it out first you have to create a config file

Example:

* Create a `config.toml` file and add the following configuration

	> On Unix `webb-relayer` looks for the config at ~/.config/webb-relayer/config.toml .

	> On MacOS `webb-relayer` looks for the config at ~/Library/Application Support/tools.webb.webb-relayer/config.toml .

```toml
# Webb Relayer Network Port
# default: 9955
port = 9955

[evm.harmony]
# Http(s) Endpoint for quick Req/Res
http-endpoint = "https://api.s1.b.hmny.io"
# Websocket Endpoint for long living connections
ws-endpoint = "wss://ws.s1.b.hmny.io"
# chain specific id.
chain-id = 1666700001
# The Private Key of this account on this network
# the format is more dynamic here:
# 1. if it starts with '0x' then this would be raw (64 bytes) hex encoded
#    private key.
#    Example: 0x8917174396171783496173419137618235192359106130478137647163400318
#
# 2. if it starts with '$' then it would be considered as an Enviroment variable
#    of a hex-encoded private key.
#    Example: $HARMONY_PRIVATE_KEY
#
# 3. if it starts with '> ' then it would be considered as a command that
#    the relayer would execute and the output of this command would be the
#    hex encoded private key.
#    Example: > pass harmony-privatekey
#
# 4. if it doesn't contains special characters and has 12 or 24 words in it
#    then we should process it as a mnemonic string: 'word two three four ...'
private-key = "0x8917174396171783496173419137618235192359106130478137647163400318"
# The fee percentage that your account will receive when you relay a transaction
# over this chain.
withdraw-fee-percentage = "0.05"
# A hex value of the gaslimit when doing a withdraw relay transaction
# on this chain.
withdraw-gaslimit = "0x350000"
# control the leaves watcher
# Note: only available for `Anchor` and `Anchor2` contracts.
anchor-leaves-watcher = { enabled = false, polling-interval = 3000 }

# chain contracts
[[evm.harmony.contracts]]
# The contract can be one of these values
# - Anchor (tornado protocol)
# - Anchor2 (darkwebb protocol)
# - Bridge
# - GovernanceBravoDelegate
contract = "Anchor"
# The address of this contract on this chain.
address = "0x4c37863bf2642Ba4e8De7e746500C700540119E8"
# the block number where this contract got deployed at.
deployed-at = 13600000
# The size of this contract
# Note: only available for `Anchor` and `Anchor2` contracts.
# and would error otherwise.
size = 0.0000000001

[[evm.harmony.contracts]]
contract = "Anchor"
address = "0x7cd1F52e5EEdf753e99D945276a725CE533AaD1a"
deployed-at = 12040000
size = 100

# and so on for other networks and other contracts and chains ...


```

Then Simply run

```
webb-relayer -vvv -c config.toml # or config.json
```

> Hot Tip 🌶️: you could also use the json format for the config file if you prefer that, and it would work!

## Using Docker 🐳

To Use Docker in and to run the relayer on any cloud provider, all you need is to create your configuration file
as it is shown above, save it into a `config` directory then you run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "./config:/config" -e WEBB_PORT=9955 -p 9955:9955 ghcr.io/webb-tools/relayer:edge
```

> Note: this uses the latest and pre-released version deployed from `main` branch, change `edge` to the latest stable release version.

This will mount a configuration file at the `/config` directory inside the container so it would allow it to read
the configuration you added.

> Note that the `json` configuration format will not work inside the docker.
