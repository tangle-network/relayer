//! # Relayer Events Watcher Module üï∏Ô∏è
//!
//! A module that listens for events on a given chain.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Event watcher traits handle the syncing and listening of events for a given network.
//! The event watcher calls into a storage for handling of important state. The run implementation
//! of an event watcher polls for blocks. Implementations of the event watcher trait define an
//! action to take when the specified event is found in a block at the `handle_event` api.
